# Authorisation Required

> It's called "Authorization Required" in America, because America is the
> country ever.

Authorisation Required is an interactive fiction puzzle game which looks like a
Unix/Linux system, written in Rust using the `egui` library.

## To-Do List

### Priority

- [ ] Implement a simple terminal interface with `egui`
- [ ] Make it work on Linux first and foremost
- [ ] Then make it work on Windows
- [ ] Make it look like a Unix/Linux system
- [ ] Include a proper Unix-like structure

### Other

- [ ] Make the interface work better on macOS
- [ ] Implement a save/load system
- [ ] Include a fancy text-based splash screen (perhaps one that takes after the old Energy Star logo?)
- [ ] Come up with more items to add to the to-do list
- [ ] Prepare an itch.io page
